## About This Project

This project was developed as part of the Web Development Internship at **Algonive**. The goal was to build a fully functional, client-side task management system that demonstrates proficiency in modern front-end technologies and best practices in UI/UX design. The application is built from the ground up without any external frameworks, focusing on pure JavaScript for all logic and interactivity.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

The current application serves as a robust foundation for a single user. The next major evolution of this project is to transform it into a **full-stack Task Management System for Small Teams**.

This will involve:
1.  **Backend Server:** Developing a server-side application to handle business logic and data processing.
2.  **Database Integration:** Moving from `localStorage` to a persistent database to store all user and task data centrally.
3.  **User Authentication:** Implementing a secure sign-up and login system for team members.
4.  **Task Assignment:** Allowing team leaders to create tasks and assign them to specific members of their team.
5.  **Role-Based Permissions:** Differentiating between roles like "Admin," "Team Leader," and "Member" to control access to features.

**Potential Tech Stack for v2.0:**
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Current Version)

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the application.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and animations.
    * **Flexbox:** For creating responsive and flexible layouts.
    * **CSS Variables:** For easy theme management and consistency.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, interactivity, and DOM manipulation.
